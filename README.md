# RockPaperScissors

## Synopsis
Rock-Paper-Scissor game based on graphtheory.

## Motivation
There was a math school module last semester, where we were introduced to discrete mathematics. One of the topics was graphtheory.
We learned the basics and some possible applications of graphisomorphism and there was an idea of a Rock-Paper-Scissor game where each
object (Rock, Paper or Scissor) is represented by a graph. Those three graphs should be non-isomorphic. When the game starts
and a player sends a isomorphic copy of his choice (e.g. Rock), the opponent can't figure out quickly which original graph was chosen.
That's because determining whether two graphs are isomorphic is very hard.
Take a look at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism_problem) for detailed informations about the graph isomorphism problem.
